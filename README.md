Webserver mangement via fabric scripts.

Design goals:
    - Manage my webservers
    - Partition fabric tasks into different packages
    - Plugable configuration system so that packages can define settings schemas, while
      the setting's values can be held in a yaml file

Future goals:
    - Manage many different packages installable via pip
    - Event and configuration handling between scripts
